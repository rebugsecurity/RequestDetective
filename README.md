# RequestDetective
Detecting request smuggling in a web application typically involves analyzing the HTTP requests and looking for anomalies or suspicious patterns. Here's an example of a C program that can help detect request smuggling attacks

# Full description of tool:
In this program, we define a function `is_request_smuggling` that takes an HTTP request as input and checks for suspicious patterns in the request headers. It looks for the presence of both `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers, which could indicate a potential request smuggling attack.

The `main` function reads an HTTP request from the user and calls the `is_request_smuggling` function to check if it contains any request smuggling indicators. It then prints the appropriate message based on the result.

Please note that this is a basic example and does not cover all possible variations and techniques of request smuggling. The detection of request smuggling attacks can be a complex task, and it's recommended to use more advanced techniques, security libraries, or dedicated security tools specifically designed for this purpose.
